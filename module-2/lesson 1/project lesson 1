    <h1>Welcome to My CSS Page</h1>

    <p>This is a simple web page using CSS. The background is light yellow, and the text is styled to be easier to read.
    </p>

    <p>We are using properties like <strong>color</strong>, <strong>font-size</strong>, and
        <strong>background-color</strong>. CSS helps us change how the page looks.</p>

    <h2>My Journey into CSS</h2>

    <p>Today I started learning CSS for the first time. I discovered that CSS is used to style HTML pages and make them
        look nice. I learned how to change the background colour, text size, font, and text colour. It was fun to see
        how a few lines of code can change the whole look of a web page. I'm exicted for next session about learning Css.. </p>
